        <p>Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that attempts to understand the essence of intelligence and produce a new kind of intelligent machine that can respond in a similar way to human intelligence. Research in this field includes robotics, language recognition, image recognition, Natural language processing and expert systems, etc. Since the birth of artificial intelligence, the theory and technology have become more and more mature, and the application field has also continued to expand. It is conceivable that the technological products brought by artificial intelligence in the future will be the "container" of human intelligence. Artificial intelligence can simulate the information process of human consciousness and thinking. Artificial intelligence is not human intelligence, but it can think like human beings and may surpass human intelligence. </p>

        <p>Computer vision is the study of how to use cameras and computers to obtain the data and information we need about the subject being photographed. To put it figuratively, it is to install eyes (cameras) and brains (algorithms) on the computer, so that the computer can perceive the environment. Computer vision is a challenging and important research area in both engineering and science. Computer vision is a comprehensive discipline, and it has attracted researchers from various disciplines to participate in its research. These include computer science and engineering, signal processing, physics, applied mathematics and statistics, neurophysiology and cognitive science, among others.</p>
